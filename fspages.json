    "/bin": "/bin is a place for most commonly used terminal commands, like ls, mount, rm, etc.",
    "/boot": "/boot contains files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files.",

    "/etc": "/etc contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's behavior for all users.",
    "/home": "/home sweet home, this is the place for users' home directories.",
    "/lib": "/lib contains important dynamic libraries and kernel modules",
    "/media": "/media is intended as a mount point for external devices, such as hard drives or removable media (floppies, CDs, DVDs).",

    "/opt": "/opt can be used to store additional software for your system, which is not handled by the package manager.",
    "/proc": "/proc is a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for kernel to send information to processes.",
    "/root": "/root is the superuser's home directory, not in /home/ to allow for booting the system even if /home/ is not available.",
    "/run": "/run is a tmpfs (temporary file system) available early in the boot process where ephemeral run-time data is stored. Files under this directory are removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process. (It deprecates various legacy locations such as /var/run, /var/lock, /lib/init/rw in otherwise non-ephemeral directory trees as well as /dev/.* and /dev/shm  which are not device files.)",
    "/sbin": "/sbin contains important administrative commands that should generally only be employed by the superuser.",

    "/var": "/var is dedicated to variable data, such as logs, databases, websites, and temporary spool (e-mail etc.) files that persist from one boot to the next. A notable directory it contains is /var/log where system log files are kept. ",

    "/etc/sudoers": "The sudoers file contains a list of users or user groups with permission to execute a subset of commands while having the privileges of the root user or another specified user."
